Sheldon met Amy, when Howard and Raj entered him on an online dating site in "The Lunar Excitation" and found his match, Amy Farrah Fowler. The guys told him and when he refused to go on the date, Raj blackmailed him with a hypothetical dirty sock. When they did meet in a caf√©, Sheldon, who came there with the sole purpose of rejecting the girl he was matched with, was taken by surprise upon meeting Amy, when she acted so similar to him. Amy told him that she only went on dates to fulfill her promise to her mother that she would go on at least one date a year.
